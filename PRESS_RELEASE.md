# DreamsBridge #

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Providing DACA renewal services free of charge, to all.

## Summary ##
  > **DreamsBridge** serves as a bridge between those who need help navigating the complex legislation surrounding DACA in the U.S. and those that are qualified to help. Immigration lawyers on **DreamsBridge** are Pro Bono so as to make the service available to all that need it and alleviate the monetary burden that lawyers can typically incur on clients. Clients will be able to sign up for the service and have the ability to select from a list of availble lawyers to chat with for any questions they have regarding their situation.

## Problem ##
  > The legislation surrounding DACA can be mercurial as it depends on the immigration agenda of the current administration. Every year on average 351,072 people apply to renew their DACA status and work authorizations. Of these applications 7% are denied, and 14% remain pending. With a potential language barrier on top of that, getting help to navigate the system can be both cumbersome and expensive. 

## Solution ##
  > Currently, DACA recipients can file for renewal by themselves, but the best course of action to ensure the highest propbability of approval is to hire a lawyer to file a renewal application on their behalf. **DreamsBridge** provides an easy and simple way to access help with legal services from professionals that are often kept behind a high monetary barrier.

## Key Technical Challenge ##
  > The most challenging technical hurdle we must overcome in order to complete this project would be creating the UI for the chat feature. Connecting the client and lawyer in a chatroom with a simple and clean UI is the biggest challenge we face along with user authentication.

## Extension Opportunities ##
  > A great strech feature to have would be the option for a video call. Having the option to video chat with a lawyer on demand would be a big help to those that cannot wait for a call back, or prefer to voice over their situation in that manner.
